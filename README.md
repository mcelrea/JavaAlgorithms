# Java Algorithms

This project is used for AP CSA and shows examples for the following algorithms:
- determine a minimum or maximum value
- compute a sum or average
- determine if at least one element has a particular property
- determine if all elements have a particular property
- determine the number of elements having a particular property
- access all consecutive pairs of elements
- determine the presence or absence of duplicate elements
- shift or rotate elements left or right
- reverse the order of the elements
